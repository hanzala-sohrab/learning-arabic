## Lesson Review
 
Every Ism has 4 properties:

1. Status
2. Number
3. Gender
4. Type

In this lesson, we will focus on the first property of Isms: **Status**. Every Ism plays a role in a sentence, and the status of that Ism tells us what **role** it plays.

(Note that in any sentence, the action taking place is always represented by the ﻓﻌﻞ, which we will cover later. Because we are only focusing on the status of the اسم, we will simply highlight the ﻓﻌﻞ of every example gray so we know not to worry about it. For now, we will focus on how to identify the person/thing doing the ﻓﻌﻞ and the details related to the ﻓﻌﻞ.)

Every sentence has a **doer** (the person or thing doing an action). The doer will always be in the **رفع (Raf’a) status**. To keep things simple for now, we will call the doer "رفع" in Arabic. Let's look at the following examples:

1. Zainab <u>ate</u> ice cream.
2. Ahmed <u>became</u> jealous.
3. The sky <u>is</u> blue.

In the first sentence, who is eating the ice cream? Zainab is, so she is the doer. In the second sentence, who became jealous? Ahmed did, so he is the doer. In the third sentence, what is blue? The sky is, so the sky is the doer.

So Zainab, Ahmed, and the sky are all doers and are all called رفع (Raf’a). 

Anything that gives extra information about the ﻓﻌﻞ is called a detail, and it will be in the **ﻧﺼﺐ Nasb status**. To keep things simple for now, we will call any detail "ﻧﺼﺐ" in Arabic. When dealing with an اسم that can be a detail, you have to turn it into a question about the ﻓﻌﻞ. For example, let’s see the questions we can ask about the sentence, "He drank juice outside yesterday quickly."

- What did he drink?
    - *juice* (detail)
- Where did he drink the juice?
    - *outside* (detail)
- When did he drink juice?
    - *yesterday* (detail)
- How did he drink juice?
    - *quickly* (detail)

Note that every question we asked included 'drink', the ﻓﻌﻞ.

Now that we understand this, let’s study the older examples looking out for اسم's that can be ﻧﺼﺐ (Nasb).

1. Zainab <u>ate</u> ice cream.
2. Ahmed <u>became</u> jealous.
3. The sky <u>is</u> blue.

In the first sentence, Zainab ate ice cream, so ice cream is the detail. Note that it answers the question, "what did Zainab eat?" In the second sentence, Ahmed became jealous, so jealous will be the detail and it answers the question, "what did Ahmed become?" In the third sentence, what is the sky? The sky is blue, so blue is the detail.

So ice cream, jealous, and blue are all details and are all called ﻧﺼﺐ.

(Note: Most sentences will usually have one رفع and one ﻓﻌﻞ but can have many ﻧﺼﺐ's.)

Let’s take a look at some additional sentences:

1. I <u>threw</u> the basketball.
    - I: رفع (doer)
    - threw: ﻓﻌﻞ (action)
    - the basketball: ﻧﺼﺐ (detail answering what I threw)

2. Salman <u>eats</u> mangoes everyday.
    - Salman: رفع (doer)
    - eats: ﻓﻌﻞ (action)
    - mangoes: ﻧﺼﺐ (detail answering what Salman eats)
    - secretly: ﻧﺼﺐ (detail answering how Salman eats)
    - everyday: ﻧﺼﺐ (detail answering when Salman eats)

Now that we have covered  رفع and ﻧﺼﺐ, we come to the third and final status, ﺟﺮ (Jarr). The easy way to remember ﺟﺮ (Jarr) is that it is the word	after 'of'. To keep things simple for now, we will call the word after 'of' "ﺟﺮ" in Arabic. Sometimes, the word 'of' is clear, but other times we have to look closely to figure out where 'of' is.

<Exercise1 />

Let&apos;s do one final example to include everything we learned so far (remember not to worry about the ﻓﻌﻞ):

1. The balloon of Abdallah popped loudly:

    - The balloon: رفع (doer; it is the thing that popped)
    - Abdallah: ﺟﺮ (the word after ‘of’) 
    - popped: ﻓﻌﻞ (action) 
    - loudly: ﻧﺼﺐ (detail answering how the balloon popped)
