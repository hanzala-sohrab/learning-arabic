## Lesson Review
 
Now that we have learnt the three statuses of {enArWords.I}, it is time to organize it in a way that is easy to memorize. The way we're going to do this is with the Muslim Chart:

جمع (Plural) | مثنى (Dual) | مفرد (Singular) | مذكر (Masculine)
--- | --- | --- | ---
مُسْلِمُوْنَ | مُسْلِمَانِ | مُسْلِمٌ | {arWords.R}
| مُسْلِمِیْنَ | مُسْلِمَیْنِ | مُسْلِمًا | {arWords.N}
| مُسْلِمِیْنَ | مُسْلِمَیْنِ | مُسْلِمٍ | {arWords.J}

There are two ways we can tell which status a word is in:

1. Ending sound
    - The three ending sounds are  ٌ◌ (un), ً◌ (an), ٍ◌ (in). Ending sounds come at the end of singular {arWords.I} only.
    - As can be seen in the chart above, each status has its own ending sound. ٌ◌ (un) is {arWords.R}, ً◌ (an) is {arWords.N}, and ٍ◌ (in) is {arWords.J}.

2. Ending combination
    - These are انِ (aani), یْنِ (ayni), وْنَ (oona), یْنَ (eena).
    - By ending combination, we mean that we look at the last two letters, instead of just the last one.
    - Ending combinations come at the end of dual and plural {arWords.I} only.
    - Note for dual and plural {arWords.I}: {arWords.N} and {arWords.J} look the same. 

Since Arabic has masculine and feminine words, we need a feminine Muslim chart as well. We call this the Muslimah Chart:

جمع (Plural) | مثنى (Dual) | مفرد (Singular) | مؤنث (Feminine)
--- | --- | --- | ---
مُسْلِمَاتٌ | مُسْلِمَتَانِ | مُسْلِمَةٌ | {arWords.R}
| مُسْلِمَاتٍ | مُسْلِمَتَیْنِ | مُسْلِمَةً | {arWords.N}
| مُسْلِمَاتٍ | مُسْلِمَتَیْنِ | مُسْلِمَةٍ | {arWords.J}

Just as with the masculine chart, we have ending sounds and ending combinations. With feminine words, we still use ending sounds and ending combinations to tell what status a word is in.

1. Ending sound (singular {arWords.I}): same as masculine, except with ۃ
2. Ending combination (dual and plural {arWords.I})
    - These are (taani), (tayni), (aatun), (aatin)
        - The dual feminine version is similar to the dual masculine version except there is an extra ت at the end
        - The plural version will have اتٔ for {arWords.R} and اتٍ for {arWords.N} and {arWords.J}.
    - It is important that we don't confuse the plural اتٔ and اتٍ with ending sounds. The double vowel ( ٌ◌,  ٍ◌) at the end makes it sound similar to singular {arWords.I}, which ends with an ending sound. To clarify this potential confusion, one should instead look for the ات ending combination.
    - Again, note for dual and plural {arWords.I}: {arWords.N} and {arWords.J} look the same. Don't be confused by this! Memorize it the way it is for now. Later on you will be able to tell the difference from context.
