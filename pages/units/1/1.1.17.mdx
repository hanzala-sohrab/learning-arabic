## Lesson Review

There are three different categories of numbers: singular, dual, and plural. The singular and dual are very easy as we've already done it:
1. Singular examples: مُسْلِمٍ , مُسْلِمًا , مُسْلِمٌ
2. Dual examples: مُسْلِمَیْنِ , مُسْلِمَیْنِ , مُسْلِمَانِ
    - Remember: The {arWords.N} and {arWords.J} forms look the same for dual {arWords.I}'s

The plural is where things get a little more detailed. There are six kinds of plurals:
1. Masculing Plural یْنَ ,وْنَ (oona, eena)
    - Used for humans, angels, and jinns
    - Includes women
        - Example: مُؤْمِنُوْنَ includes both male and female believers
2. Human Feminine Plural اتٍ , اتٌ (aatun, aatin)
    - Used for female humans
        - Examples: مُسْلِمَاتٌ (female Muslims), مُؤْمِنَاتٍ (female believers)
3. Non-Human Feminine Plural اتٍ , اتٌ (aatun, aatin)
    - Plurals of things that aren't human are treated as 'she' (feminine singular words)
        - Examples: سَمَاوَاتٌ (skies), سَیَّارَاتٍ (cars)
    - Instead of saying 'they are books', the Arabs would say 'she is books'. It sounds strange in English but it is appropriate in Arabic. Thus, for Non-Human Plurals, they are treated like a 'she' even though they are plural. In other words, the gender and number for a Non-Human Plural would be Feminine and Singular.
        - Examples: "Toys, I love her", "She is beautiful buildings"
4. Human Broken Plural
5. Non-Human Broken Plural
    - Just like the Non-Human Feminine Plural, this Non-Human Broken Plural is treated like a 'she', and thus its gender and number would be Feminine and Singular
6. Ism Jam'a اسم جمع

Important note to remember: All non-human plurals are treated as 'she' (feminine singular words) in Arabic.
