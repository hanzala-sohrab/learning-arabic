## Lesson Review

There are three different categories of numbers: singular, dual, and plural. The singular and dual are very easy as we've already done it:
1. Singular examples: مُسْلِمٍ , مُسْلِمًا , مُسْلِمٌ
2. Dual examples: مُسْلِمَیْنِ , مُسْلِمَیْنِ , مُسْلِمَانِ
    - Remember: The {arWords.N} and {arWords.J} forms look the same for dual {arWords.I}'s

The plural is where things get a little more detailed. There are six kinds of plurals:
1. Masculine Plural یْنَ ,وْنَ (oona, eena)
    - Used for humans, angels, and jinns
    - Includes women
        - Example: مُؤْمِنُوْنَ includes both male and female believers
2. Human Feminine Plural اتٍ , اتٌ (aatun, aatin)
    - Used for female humans
        - Examples: مُسْلِمَاتٌ (female Muslims), مُؤْمِنَاتٍ (female believers)
3. Non-Human Feminine Plural اتٍ , اتٌ (aatun, aatin)
    - Plurals of things that aren't human are treated as 'she' (feminine singular words)
        - Examples: سَمَاوَاتٌ (skies), سَیَّارَاتٍ (cars)
    - Instead of saying 'they are books', the Arabs would say 'she is books'. It sounds strange in English but it is appropriate in Arabic. Thus, for Non-Human Plurals, they are treated like a 'she' even though they are plural. In other words, the gender and number for a Non-Human Plural would be Feminine and Singular.
        - Examples: "Toys, I love her", "She is beautiful buildings"
4. Human Broken Plural
5. Non-Human Broken Plural
    - Just like the Non-Human Feminine Plural, this Non-Human Broken Plural is treated like a 'she', and thus its gender and number would be Feminine and Singular
6. Ism Jam'a اسم جمع

Important note to remember: All non-human plurals are treated as 'she' (feminine singular words) in Arabic.

### Qur'an Gem

وَکَانَتْ مِنَ الْقَانِتِیْنَ

Allah is talking about Maryam (AS). He says about her وَکَانَتْ مِنَ الْقَانِتِیْنَ that she was from amongst who were devoutly obedient. The word الْقَانِتِیْنَ has an یْنَ ending combination, which is used for men. The masculine plural has ending combinations یْنَ/وْنَ while feminine plurals have ending combinations اتٌ/اتٍ. Remember, the masculine plural encompasses both men and women, while the feminine plural encompasses only women.

Maryam (AS) was a female so it would make sense to say: وَکَانَتْ مِنَ الْقَانِتَاتِ. But her faith in and devotion to Allah was so vast, so beautiful, and so encompassing that Allah wanted to point out that she is a role model to all mankind: both men and women. This is why the masculine plural is used: وَکَانَتْ مِنَ الْقَانِتِیْنَ
