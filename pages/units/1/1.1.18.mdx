## Lesson Review
There are six categories of plurals: Masculine Plural, Human Feminine Plural, Non-Human Feminine Plural, Human Broken Plural, Non-Human Broken Plural, and Ism Jam'a. We will now focus on the two broken plurals.

Every word has a plural, but not all plurals are straightforward. Although you can add an 's' to the end of some words (example: house -> houses), it isn't that straightforward for others (example: mouse -> mice, not mouses). Words that you can add an 's' to at the end are normal plurals. Words that you cannot simply add an 's' to at the end are called broken plurals. 

In Arabic, the اتٍ/اتٌ/یْنَ/وْنَ plural ending combinations are equivalent to adding an 's' to the end of a word. Thus, when we see any of those ending combinations, we know the word is a regular plural. However, broken plurals are common too. An example of a broken plural is مَسْجِدٌ. The plural of the word is . To make it plural, we didn't add a normal ending combination (اتٍ/اتٌ/یْنَ/وْنَ). Instead, we changed the original word; thus the new word is called a broken plural. *When a plural word does not contain its original word, it is a broken plural.*

Remember that regular plurals come in three categories: یْنَ/وْنَ for masculine plurals, اتٍ/اتٌ for human feminine plurals, اتٍ/اتٌ for non-human feminine plurals. Every other plural is a broken plural.

There are two kinds of broken plurals
1. Human Broken Plurals
    - These plurals are human, so there are two choices for identifying these plurals: you can either treat them as 'she' (feminine, singular) OR 'they' (masculine/feminine, plural)
    - Examples:
        - أَنْبِیَاءُ : نَبِیٌّ (prophet : prophets)
            - This is a broken plural, which we would automatically consider to be 'she' (feminine, singular). However, because it's also human, we have the option of calling it 'they' (masculine, plural).
        - کُفَّارٌ : کَافِرٌ (disbeliever : disbelievers)
            - 'She' (feminine, singular) OR 'they' (masculine, plural)
2. Non-Human Broken Plurals
    - These plurals are not human, so we refer to them only as 'she' (feminine, singular).
    - Examples:
        - أقْلَامٌ : قَلَمٌ (pen : pens)
            - Feminine, singular
        - کُتُبٍ : کِتَابٍ (book : books)
            - Feminine, singular

Remember that all broken plurals (human and non-human) in Arabic are identified as 'she' (feminine, singular). The only difference between the two categories of broken plurals is that human broken plurals CAN be identified as they are. This is why in the aforementioned examples, عُلَمَاءُ (human broken plural) is 'she' (feminine, singular) OR 'they' (masculine, plural). But أقْلَامٌ (non-human broken plural) can only be 'she' (feminine, singular).
