## Lesson Review
 
Arabic is made up of three types of words. Every word in Arabic will fall under one of these three categories:
1. اسم: An Ism can be a person, place, thing, idea, adjective, adverb, and more. Let's look at some examples:
    - Person: Mohammad, Fatima, he, she, I, we
    - Place: New Delhi, Jamshedpur
    - Thing: laptop, pen, book, car
    - Ideas are things we have names for but can't touch. e.g. happiness, love, patience, education, reflection
      - Note that words that end in _'ing'_ can also be ideas, given the appropriate context. e.g. I love _learning_, I like _writing_
    - Adjectives describe things. e.g. big masjid, small desk, handsome vase, ugly carpet, beautiful car, happy cat, sad person
    - Adverbs describe an action being done. e.g. running <u>quickly</u>, eating <u>slowly</u>, worked <u>sleepily</u>, will exercise <u>happily</u>

2. فعل: A Fi’l is a word which is always in the past, present, or future tense. Fi’ls are similar to verbs in English but not exactly the same.
    - Examples of Fi’ls in English: ran, created, eating, reads, will write

3. حرف: A Harf is a word that does not make sense unless there is another word after it.
    - Examples of Harfs in English: in, at, for, with, to
