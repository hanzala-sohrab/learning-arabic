## Lesson Review

There are four parts to understanding status, of which we will now cover the first three:
1. Form:
    - {arWords.R}: doer
    - {arWords.N}: detail
    - {arWords.J}: word after 'of'
2. How to tell status
    - By ending sound
      - {arWords.R} ٌ◌ (un) or ُ◌ (oo)
      - {arWords.N} ً◌ (an) or َ◌ (aa)
      - {arWords.J} ٍ◌ (in) or ِ◌ (ee) 
    - By ending combination
      - Pair combinations: انِ (aani), یْنِ (ayni)
      - Plural combinations: وْنَ (oona), یْنَ (eena)
      - Feminine plural combinations: اتٌ (aatun), اتٍ (aatin)
3. Light vs. Heavy
    - By default, {arWords.I}'s are heavy, meaning that they have a 'ن' sound at the end. If you were to recite the Muslim chart you would notice that every words ends in a 'ن' sound. There are two types of heavy:
      - Heavy due to sound: the word has a 'ن' sound because of a double vowel (tanween) at the end
        - Examples: مُسْلِمٌ ,حبِیْبًا ,کِتَابٍ
      - Heavy due to ending combination: the word ends in the letter 'ن' so it is heavy
        - Examples: مُسْلِمُوْنَ ,کِتَابَیْنِ ,کَلِمَتَانِ
      - In some special cases we can make an {arWords.I} light, meaning we remove the 'ن' sound from the end.
