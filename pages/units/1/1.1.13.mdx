## Lesson Review

There are four parts to understanding status, of which we will now cover the first three:
1. Form:
    - {arWords.R}: doer
    - {arWords.N}: detail
    - {arWords.J}: word after 'of'
2. How to tell status
    - By ending sound
      - {arWords.R} ٌ◌ (un) or ُ◌ (oo)
      - {arWords.N} ً◌ (an) or َ◌ (aa)
      - {arWords.J} ٍ◌ (in) or ِ◌ (ee) 
    - By ending combination
      - Pair combinations: انِ (aani), یْنِ (ayni)
      - Plural combinations: وْنَ (oona), یْنَ (eena)
      - Feminine plural combinations: اتٌ (aatun), اتٍ (aatin)
3. Light vs. Heavy
    - By default, {arWords.I}'s are heavy, meaning that they have a 'ن' sound at the end. If you were to recite the Muslim chart you would notice that every words ends in a 'ن' sound. There are two types of heavy:
      - Heavy due to sound: the word has a 'ن' sound because of a double vowel (tanween) at the end
        - Examples: مُسْلِمٌ ,حبِیْبًا ,کِتَابٍ
      - Heavy due to ending combination: the word ends in the letter 'ن' so it is heavy
        - Examples: مُسْلِمُوْنَ ,کِتَابَیْنِ ,کَلِمَتَانِ
      - In some special cases we can make an {arWords.I} light, meaning we remove the 'ن' sound from the end.
        - We have to be careful which kind of 'ن' we remove. We can only remove the 'ن' if it comes from an ending tanween sound (ٍ◌, ً◌, ٌ◌) or from an ending combination (وْنَ, یْنَ). In the word 'نُعْمَان', the 'ن' at the end is part of the word so we can't remove it.
      - One important thing to remember: if a word has 'ال' on it like 'اَلْمُسْلِمُوْنَ', it is neither light nor heavy.
      - Note that the status doesn't change if an {enArWords.I} is light or heavy. For example, مُسْلِمُوْنَ is {enArWords.R}, plural, and masculine. The light version, مُسْلِمُوْ will also be {enArWords.R}, plural, and masculine.

Recall the Muslim and Muslimah Charts we learnt:

جمع (Plural) | مثنى (Dual) | مفرد (Singular) | مذكر (Masculine)
--- | --- | --- | ---
مُسْلِمُوْنَ | مُسْلِمَانِ | مُسْلِمٌ | {arWords.R}
| مُسْلِمِیْنَ | مُسْلِمَیْنِ | مُسْلِمًا | {arWords.N}
| مُسْلِمِیْنَ | مُسْلِمَیْنِ | مُسْلِمٍ | {arWords.J}

جمع (Plural) | مثنى (Dual) | مفرد (Singular) | مؤنث (Feminine)
--- | --- | --- | ---
مُسْلِمَاتٌ | مُسْلِمَتَانِ | مُسْلِمَةٌ | {arWords.R}
| مُسْلِمَاتٍ | مُسْلِمَتَیْنِ | مُسْلِمَةً | {arWords.N}
| مُسْلِمَاتٍ | مُسْلِمَتَیْنِ | مُسْلِمَةٍ | {arWords.J}

Now, we can look at the same charts but in their light form:

جمع (Plural) | مثنى (Dual) | مفرد (Singular) | مذكر (Masculine)
--- | --- | --- | ---
مُسْلِمُوْ | مُسْلِمَا | مُسْلِمُ | {arWords.R}
| مُسْلِمِیْ | مُسْلِمَیْ | مُسْلِمَ | {arWords.N}
| مُسْلِمِیْ | مُسْلِمَیْ | مُسْلِمِ | {arWords.J}

جمع (Plural) | مثنى (Dual) | مفرد (Singular) | مؤنث (Feminine)
--- | --- | --- | ---
مُسْلِمَاتُ | مُسْلِمَتَا | مُسْلِمَةُ | {arWords.R}
| مُسْلِمَاتِ | مُسْلِمَتَیْ | مُسْلِمَةَ | {arWords.N}
| مُسْلِمَاتِ | مُسْلِمَتَیْ | مُسْلِمَةِ | {arWords.J}
