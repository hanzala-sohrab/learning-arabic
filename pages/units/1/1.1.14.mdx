## Lesson Review

Recall that there are four parts to understanding status, the first three of which we have covered before. The fourth and final part to understanding status is flexibility. There are three different types of flexibilities: fully flexible, partly flexible, and non-flexible. For now, we will focus only on partly flexible.

Four parts of status

1. Form ({arWords.J} ,{arWords.N} ,{arWords.R})
   -  Remember, both heavy and light {arWords.I}'s will have the same form. For example, مُسْلِمٌ (heavy) and مُسْلِمُ (light) will be both {arWords.R}
2. How to tell status (ending sound vs. ending combination)
3. Light vs. Heavy
4. Flexibility
    - Fully flexible
    - Partly flexible
    - Non-flexible

Partly flexible words have special rules that only apply to them. There are two categories of partly flexible words:
    - Names of places
      - Examples: Makkah, New Delhi, Jamshedpur
    - Non-Arab names (names that don't come from the Arabic language)
      - Examples: Arthur, Suleiman

There are two things partly flexible words can never do:
1. They can never have a tanween (ٍ◌, ً◌, ٌ◌)
    - Another way of saying this is that they are always light
2. They can never have kasrah (ِ◌)
    - They will always end with a fatha (َ◌) or a dumma (ُ◌)
    - Because of these rules, partly flexible {arWords.I}'s that are {arWords.R} will have a  ُ◌ (ابراھیمُ) while the {arWords.N} and {arWords.J} both take a  َ◌ (ابراھیمَ)

Refer to the chart below:
Arab name (fully flexible) | Non-Arab name (partly flexible) | Name of place (partly flexible) | Status
--- | --- | --- | ---
مُحَمَّدٌ | اِبْرَاھِیْمُ | مَکَّةُ | {enArWords.R}
| مُحَمَّدً | اِبْرَاھِیْمَ | مَکَّةَ | {enArWords.N}
| مُحَمَّدٍ | اِبْرَاھِیْمَ | مَکَّةَ | {enArWords.J}

Notice that the name of place and non-Arab names are always light. An Arab name will be heavy by default, but it can be made light. With a non-Arab name, it is light by default because it is partly flexible; it cannot be heavy. There are four prophets mentioned in the Qur'an that 
are Arab. They are:
- محمدٌ صلى الله عليه وسلم
- ھودٌ عليه السلام
- صالحٌ عليه السلام
- شعیبٌ عليه السلام

All the other prophets' names mentioned in the Qur'an are non-Arab names and are thus partly flexible.

Let's briefly look at the other two parts of flexibility:
1. Fully flexible: These are regular Arabic words
    - They take tanween and kasrah normally. Take a look at the Muslim chart for good examples of fully flexible words
2. Partly flexible: Names of places and non-Arab names
    - They can't take a kasrah and are light (no tanween)
3. Non-flexible: Words that never change
    - These are words like . These words can be {arWords.R}, {arWords.N}, or {arWords.J}, but they will always look the same, regardless of which status they are in. Usually words ending in ی or ا are non-flexible.

Non-flexible | Partly flexible | Fully flexible | Status
--- | --- | --- | ---
مُوْسَی | اِبْرَاھِیْمُ | مُسْلِمٌ | {enArWords.R}
| مُوْسَی | اِبْرَاھِیْمَ | مُسْلِمًا | {enArWords.N}
| مُوْسَی | اِبْرَاھِیْمَ | مُسْلِمٍ | {enArWords.J}
