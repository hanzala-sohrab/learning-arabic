## Lesson Review

Recall that there are three types of flexibility: fully flexible, partly flexible, and non-flexible:

1. Fully flexible: These are regular Arabic words
    - They take tanween and kasrah normally. Take a look at the Muslim chart for good examples of fully flexible words
2. Partly flexible: Names of places and non-Arab names
    - They can't take a kasrah and are light (no tanween)
3. Non-flexible: Words that never change
    - These are words like . These words can be {arWords.R}, {arWords.N}, or {arWords.J}, but they will always look the same, regardless of which status they are in. Usually words ending in ی or ا are non-flexible.

Non-flexible | Partly flexible | Fully flexible | Status
--- | --- | --- | ---
مُوْسَی | اِبْرَاھِیْمُ | مُسْلِمٌ | {enArWords.R}
| مُوْسَی | اِبْرَاھِیْمَ | مُسْلِمًا | {enArWords.N}
| مُوْسَی | اِبْرَاھِیْمَ | مُسْلِمٍ | {enArWords.J}
