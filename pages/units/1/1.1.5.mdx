## Lesson Review
 
In English we recognize doers and details mainly by the order in which they come in a sentence. 

1. The teachers helped the students. 
2. The students helped the teachers. 

In the first sentence, the teachers are the doer and the students are the detail. In the second sentence, the students are the doer and the teachers are the detail. In these two sentences, the meaning changes completely because we changed the order of 'teachers' and 'students.' But in Arabic, the order of the doer and detail does not matter. What matters is the sound at the end of each word. Note the different sounds:

If a word ends in  ُ◌ or وْنَ (oona) we know that is the doer and is رفع. If a word ends in  َیْن (eena) or َ◌ we know that it is the detail and is ﻧﺼﺐ.

This all may sound a bit confusing, so let’s take a look at some examples: 

1. سَاعَدَ المُدَرَّسُوْنَ الطُلَّابَ: The teachers helped the students.
    - This sentence has three words. Here's what they mean:

        - سَاعَدَ: helped (فعل because it's stuck in the past tense)

        - المُدَرَّسُوْنَ: the teachers

        - الطُلَّابَ: the students
    - The word المُدَرَّسُوْنَ ends with وْنَ so it is the doer and رفع
    - The word الطُلَّابَ ends with  َ◌ so it is the detail and نصب

2. سَاعَدَ المُدَرِّسِیْنَ الطُلَّابُ: The students helped the teachers.

    - المُدَرِّسِیْنَ ends with یْنَ so it is the detail and نصب

    - الطُلَّابُ ends with  ُ◌ so it is the doer and رفع

3. سَاعَدَ الطُلَّابُ المُدَرِّسِیْنَ: The students helped the teachers.

    - الطُلَّابُ ends with  ُ◌ so it is the doer and رفع

    - المُدَرِّسِیْنَ ends with یْنَ so it is the detail and نصب

4. سَاعَدَ الطُلَّابَ المُدَرَّسُوْنَ: The teachers helped the students.

    - The word الطُلَّابَ ends with  َ◌ so it is the detail and نصب

    - The word المُدَرَّسُوْنَ ends with وْنَ so it is the doer and رفع

5. المُدَرِّسِیْنَ سَاعَدَ الطُلَّابُ: The students helped the teachers.

    - المُدَرِّسِیْنَ ends with یْنَ so it is the detail and نصب

    - الطُلَّابُ ends with  ُ◌ so it is the doer and رفع

6. الطُلَّابَ سَاعَدَ المُدَرَّسُوْنَ: The teachers helped the students.

    - The word الطُلَّابَ ends with  َ◌ so it is the detail and نصب

    - The word المُدَرَّسُوْنَ ends with وْنَ so it is the doer and رفع

All we need to do is look for the endings of the اسم's. If we find an اسم the ends in  ُ◌ or وْنَ we know that is the doer and رفع in the sentence. If we find and اسم that ends in  َ◌ or  َیْن we know that is the detail and نصب in the sentence. The order of the words in the sentence makes no difference in Arabic whatsoever (including the فعل: notice that the فعل can appear anywhere). The only thing that matters is what the sound is at the end of each word.
